# ESP8266-IOT-Sketch
This is the sketch I wrote to automate my ceiling fans remote control functions using an ESP8266 with Amazon Echo using Fauxmo

It uses an ESP8266 Node MCU Board and it uses Fauxmo to be recognizable by Alexa

The Board was attached to a hampton bay ceiling fan remote using the buttons controls and blinking is used to mimic button presses
